Project description 
We aim to create an application that acts as a platform to allow current students and alumni to give detailed hands on reviews of 
a university based on factors that are not covered in a universityâ€™s promotions. Additional tools will be given to the user, such 
as live chat rooms for discussions with current students, on matters such as courses and facilities, to a comment-based system on 
each review. with the aim to provide a new student with as much real-world information as possible so they can make a truly informed 
decision about where to go to start their path into higher education.
The application will be cross platform (Android and IOS) and will be written in a non-native language to application development.

Results
We have produced the application in python and have then used Buildozer to make the conversions necessary to allow the application 
to run on Android and IOS. Kivy, and a subset of Kivy (KivyMD), has been used to create a working UI that allows a user to navigate
through several pages relating to each university. 
Data is stored using a cloud-based database that can store information relating to each university along with login in credentials 
for each user. Additional features have been implemented but are still being tested, as such they are not yet ready for deployment; 
the live chat is accessible but currently runs on a locally hosted server and the comment-based system is in the process of being 
implemented.
