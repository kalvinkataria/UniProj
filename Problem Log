Installing Toga via command line may give a sandbox error - states the installation is trying to take place out of the bounds 
of the easyInstaller(pip)

Fix - Use python version 3.7.5 as apposed to version 3.8.0 
      The Pipenv tool can then be used to install the modules and allows for the import into the IDE (PyCharm)
      
cont . Same issue when trying to import using third part tool i.e anaconda

The toga modle uses "colosseum" version 0.2.0. This can cause issues at run time when the toga module is imported into the project -
It relates to the creation of GUI elements 

Fix - use pipenv via on cmd line to uninstall the newer version and reinstall version 0.1.6

-- Example --

//Uninstall colosseum from the current project(untitled3(
C:\Users\Charles-PC\PycharmProjects\untitled3>pipenv run pip uninstall colosseum

//reinstall the older version into the project folder usinf the pipenv tool 
C:\Users\Charles-PC\PycharmProjects\untitled3>pipenv run pip install colosseum==0.1.6

Aspects of the toga dependencies are causing a run time error, i believe it relates to the module that will eventually convert the python
code into something that can be run on IOS and Android.

- Going to remove the dependencies until they are need and address the issue then. This will the project to continue until the conversion 
  needs to take place. This does limit our ability to create a proof of concept however.

Circular imports are an issue in python, we need to plan arround them to insure it does not cause more issues further along in the project

There may be an issue with the Toga support for windows. Running into an error for version 0.3.0 in which there is an unsupported element
This means that the newer elements of the tool kit are not usable

After again trying to creat a proff of concept for the project using Toga i have run into a range of errors that requier work arounds. 
While i have been able to work through the majority of these there are still some underliying issues due to the lack of support for 
aspects of IOS by the toga toolkit. 

I'm now looking into Kivy as a replacment as the documentation and support is far better and  at first glance there are no issues relating 
to intergration or platform support.

-- Chagning to Kivy

Buildozer is very difficult to initally work with. I have been reading up alot and have found that the issue is due to it's suppport of 
OS, it will only work on specific versions of Linux. 

- Setting up a dual boot of Ubuntu as a work around to the issue. This does slow the prototyping process pretty significantly however.

Pycharm doen's foramt .kv files correctly, this makes writting the front end code very difficult as python is very sensitive to spaceing an 
indentation.

- I have found a subsetting that allows for the indentation to be shown, it does not fully support other elements of python but it has made 
  a massive improvemnt to workflow.

Kivy can use images as button icons but the images have to be stored within the project files, this makes the files pretty big and it's 
very sensitive to path changes ect. Made a small change to a file path and have had to reset the paths of a load of images. 

 - I don't want to have to make these changes every time a path chnages ect so i'm going to ty using kivyMD, this is a imported package 
   a libaray of images, icons ect that can be used.

Use case issue: The anaconda package manager does not support kikyMD as is technically a beta package (not supported in due to anaconda T&C)
                as the kivyMD package is very use full i'm going to switch over to using the base interpreter which will solve the issue.
                
                - This does mean that all packages will have to manually imported and set up manually but this is easier then the alternative
                  managment of images, layouts ect ect

The kivy styling file ("Front end") is running into a "to many levels" error due to the number of methods called by one of the UI buttons.

- I have moved all the code onto a single line, this does get flagged by pycharm but i have disabled the styling guide so it still builds.
  This does go against the python styling guid of not allowin a line to be over 79 characters, it is currently one line so i'm not ovelry worried.

The animation style of kivy only allows for a single widget (as far as i can see) to be passed to an animation method. as the nav bar wil have 
~ 6 items this means there will be 6 open and 6 close animation methods. Currently looking for a solution but not able to find one as of yet.

The current chat client/server use a type of list to display the chat and another scrollable widget object to give the scroll functunality.
This isn't a very elegent solution and i have just found that it is a massive drain on memory, the current solution isn't going to work 
in the long term.

- I am making large changes to the chat client and server, this will include implementing a memory friendly display window , recyclerview is 
  looking to be the best option, as well as moving the whole system into a callable widget - not inc the server/client functions. 
- The clinet and server funcations may need to be moved over into the main code body at some point in the future.

Error handling of the .kv file by pycharm ives very few details about errors. Currently have a parse error - "  if current_property[:3] == 'on_':
 TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable". 
 
- After some digging this actually means the file has a fromatting error. I think this can also be throw for a ny number of issues how ever.
- Don't have an easy fix for this, wor flow is slowed trying to fix simple errors that would normally be displayed at run time.

Note: You need to be very carful when adding to the .kv file (Front end) as a single error will crash everything and it taks a logng time 
      to work out the errors

- More errors to do with the .kv file and the way it's proecessed -- error:  

c.center = x + value[0] * w, y + value[1] * h
 TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable
 
- I have found that this is to do with the way the layouts are handeled when adding custom widgets in terms on position on each screen 
  within a screen manager. The normal dictunary of usable locations i.e center , top , bottom don't all work. 
- Can't find any real documentation about it online so going to work around it using custom locations set in the widgets

  - Attempting to change the chat client to allow for multiple chat rooms, currently unable to find a way to implement it. Very little documentation
    online. 
    
  - Will need to look deeper into the issue when other app elements are completed

 - The support for KivyMD is no longer being updated, some elemtents of widgets are not documented or are documented incorrectly for the newer 
    version of Kivy. 
 - Some functunality has been lost after the kivy update, some widget elements are needing slight work arounds. Some good news 
   in that new some new features are working with the older version of KivyMD

- Push was made to master without notifiying the whole group first, some minor work duplication but some extra changes need to now be made 
  to accomodate changes 
  
- Need to let everyone know when changes are being pused and what they involve

- Buildozer has an issue relating to the "hand shake " between a android (May also effect IOS) devices and the main system. There is a workaround 
  on the buildozer site but it also has a number of issues 
  
- I may have a work around by making changes to the hand held device to remove the need for confermation of data transfer but his isn't exactly secure
  in the long term

 - VM Box has had an update and is in some way effecting the stability of buildozer. I have no idea why this is happeening and as far as i know it hsould 
   not efffect the operation of the application in the VM in anyway 
   
 - I'm currenlty looking for any other erason why there would be stability issues with buildozer, i'm oing to start by checking 
   that it's not being limied by onboard memory. If this is the case i don't have a fix as i only have this laptop to hand.
